# microservice_template
This is a template for future microservices. New microservice repos should be copied from this one so that our basic infrastructure is consistent across services.

This template has a number of examples of how to perform different database actions and should not necessarily be taken as gospel for how to design an api - but rather as a resource for how to handle scenarios that may arise as we construct a new service.
